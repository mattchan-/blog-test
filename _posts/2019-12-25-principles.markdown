What are the highest value cognitive investing activities we can engage in? How can these be reduced further?

 1. Manipulate the environment and habits to minimize willpower necessary.

 2. Structure, but don’t plan.

    a. Structure enables flow and keeps oneself open to new opportunities and insights. It relies on trusting one’s intuition on where to focus their energies next.

 3. Set directions, not goals or outcomes. Keep options open, i,e Henry Singleton

    a. Not blinding ourselves with the blinders inherent in focus.

 4. Don’t look for immediate ROI on learning. Look for building a framework and discovering hidden connections.

 5. Omnidisciplinary

 6. Holistic, not reductionist.

 7. Regularly destroy and create aspects of the schema.

 8. Search out for mismatches with the schema.

 9. Work simultaneously on many projects, focusing on whatever one is most interesting at the moment (Da Vinci/Luhmann/Feynman method).

10. Serendipity

11. Curiosity

12. Not planning for a specific end

13. Simultaneously embracing the vague uncertainty of the future

14. We want to preserve and link insight, not create a linked encyclopedia.
